<h3>What is meditation?</h3>
<p>Meditation isn’t about becoming a different person, a new person, or even a better person.<br> It’s about training in awareness and getting a healthy sense of perspective.<br> You’re not trying to turn off your thoughts or feelings. You’re learning to observe them without judgment. And eventually, you may start to better understand them as well.</p>
